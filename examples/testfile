AsyncESuspend <label id> <number of iterators>   [C:Obj]  ->  [C:Obj]

  Suspends an eagerly executed async function into an AsyncFunctionWaitHandle
  object.  The AsyncFunctionWaitHandle object will capture all defined local
  variables and the first %2 iterators in the current eagerly executed async
  function, and mark them uninitialized on the current frame.  The object will
  store a reference to the associated resumable async function and a label %1
  to be used to resume the execution once the WaitHandle object given by $1 is
  finished.  If the $1 is not a WaitHandle, or is a WaitHandle that is already
  finished, the behavior is undefined.

AsyncWrapResult   [C]  ->  [C:Obj]

  Wraps $1 into a StaticResultWaitHandle object.

AsyncWrapException   [C:Obj]  ->  [C:Obj]

  Wraps $1 into a StaticExceptionWaitHandle object.  If $1 is not an Exception,
  the behavior is undefined.
